                <h2>Congressional App Changllege</h2>
                <p>Fall, 2016</p>
                <p class="indent">
                   This is the video that my team and I submitted for the Congressional App Challenge. The purpose of the challenge is to came up with a idea and sell it to the judges. The app we created is called 2DAY, which is a friend finder with planer and school map navigation. The purpose of the app is to find friend that had similar interest and help student in everyday school, but there isn't a main function of the app. The things that I will change to make it better will be focusing on the friend finder part, because the app doesn’t have a main focus to it, which makes it difficult to grab people’s attention.

                <h2>Feature Story</h2>
                <p>Spring, 2015</p>
                <p class="indent">
                    This is the first feature story that I created in Video Production. The assignment is to create a three minute feature story that will tell a story rather than report the story. My feature story is telling about the difficult time that my family went through when we first came to United States. After looking back to this video, I found out that I can bring up the brightness of the video and add in more b-roll to entertain the audience. Overall, I had a great time making this story.

                <h2>Flash Animation</h2>
                <p>Spring, 2016</p>
                <p class="indent">
                    This is the first time I played with Adobe Flash. This assignment is assigned to the class by my Graphic Design teacher. The goal for this assignment is to create an animated figure to run across the forest from day to night. When I first started the project, I was very exciting because i'm very into animation. Even Though the project is based on the bone tool, but working with frames and timing caught on my attention. When I look back at this video, I notices that the character move faster at the second layer and even faster at the far back. It is caused by the length of the clip. All three walking clips are the same length, but the character is smaller and the scene is farer, which makes it looks like the character is speeding up. Next time dealing with timing, I will not make the same mistake again.

                <h2>Wordpress Theme Project</h2>
                <p>Spring, 2017</p>
                <p class="indent">
                    This is the last project in the school year of Web Development. The purpose of this project is to help us learn about Wordpress while creating a End of Course Exam Study website for the incoming exam taker. The end result of the project will be fully functional Wordpress theme. During the process of making the theme, I found out that the viarity of plug-ins and the ability to interact witht the user is what makes Wordpress great. I think I will be use Wordpress more from now on to help me create my future website.
