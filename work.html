                <p class="indent">
                    This is the second project that was assigned in Web Design. The goal for this assignment is to create a fully responsive website in the theme of winter escape that can be view on a mobile device, ipad, and on desktop. Another requirement for this assignment is to make the website printable, so when printing the website, it will be easier to read and still had the overall look of the website. This assignment taught me many things, it give me a better understanding in the process of creating responsive Website, and gain new skill in programing. I learn about media queries, url, and adding class name to a element by using Javascript. Overall, this is a very interesting assignment and I will use this skill in my future website developement.

                <p class="indent">
                    This is the first website project that was assigned to us in Web Design in junior year. The goal of this project is to create a online quiz based on javascript. The goal of this assignment is to create a online quiz with using array and innerhtml. When I was first working on it, I had a difficult time working with javascript. I wasn't able to display the question with answer choices onto the website. In the end, all the questions are hardcoded rather than in the javascript file, which is not very a javascript quiz. Over the past few days after the project, I rework on the website and now the website is fully function by javascript.

                    This is the first project that was assigned to the class in Graphic Design. The goal of this project is to create a logo that matches with the mission statement that we created. The mission statement for me is, "Our mission is to create simple, friendly design that connects the audience to our client." I use bright color and a paper folded flower to represent the logo in order to show friendly. The overall design is based on paper folding, which show a sense of simplicity and folding paper means that everything comes together to become one. During this project, I learned how to take critiques from others and use it to improve the design.

                    This assignment is to modify yourself by using the liquify tool in Photoshop. The goal of this assignment is to manipulate yourself into something else and have a better understanding of the tools in photoshop. When working on this image, I had a fun time in enlarging myself, and it result in me looks like a goblin. When looking back to this project, I found that I did a poor job in scaling the forehead and the chin. The forehead and the chin looks like an oil paint. Thing that I  could do to make it better are erasing some of the brightness in my forehead and chin.

                    This is the second project assigned in Graphic Design class. The purpose of this  project is to create a design to explain one of the fair use topic. Every people in the group is responsible for one of the design, rather it is a poster, flyer, or fold out. The design had to have a specific art style, and it should grab people’s attention. The art style that my group choose is “Swiss”, this art style is simple design and doesn’t rely heavily on graphic, and the main typeface is Helvetica. When I first started this project, I had a hard time coming up with idea because I don’t really know about the swiss design. After doing research on Swiss design and look at some other’s work, I had a better understanding of Swiss design. From this project, I gain a real life experience, when designing for a client, the client won’t always had the same style as me.

                    The Winter PBl for this year is to create an app with MIT App Inventor and teach middle schooler on the process of creating the app. The app that my team and I created is called FitFriday, which is to keep track of hours exercised and motivate youth to exercise.  Since App Inventor is a web based program and it is mainly drag and drop, it doesn’t have too much of flexibility. At the beginning of creating the app, it is hard to get the element onto the app, but after playing with it. We got the hang of it. The programing for this app is like a logic statement. For example, it is more like if this happen, then this follows it. It is a fun time in the creation of the app and teaching the little ones. One thing will change for this presentation will be cutting down some part of the app, because it exceed the time each time.

Macbeth is the main character in the play, and it show that he had change from a trustworthy person to a truant, and I use it as the main point of my essay. Before writing this essay, my teacher teach the class a new way to organize the outline. By using the outline, I had a easier way to write my essay and get my point through in a fewer sentences.

                    The assignment is historical narrative, where the students had to write an engaging story that is historical accurate. In the process of writing the story, I was struggled in the building up of the character. Because I wasn't around in that time period, so I had a difficult time in coming up with the story. Luckily, from the use of both primary and secondary source, I had a better understanding of the historical event and the people, and allow me to write a historical accurate story.

The newspaper mainly talks about the connection between the growth of communication and the expand of railroad. At the same time, my US History is going over the rapid growth of invention.

The app we created is called 2DAY, which is a friend finder with planer and school map navigation. The purpose of the app is to find friend that had similar interest and help student in everyday school, but there isn't a main function of the app. The things that I will change to make it better will be focusing on the friend finder part, because the app doesn’t have a main focus to it, which makes it difficult to grab people’s attention.

                    This is the first feature story that I created in Video Production. The assignment is to create a three minute feature story that will tell a story rather than report the story. My feature story is telling about the difficult time that my family went through when we first came to United States. After looking back to this video, I found out that I can bring up the brightness of the video and add in more b-roll to entertain the audience. Overall, I had a great time making this story.

                <p class="indent">
                    This is the first time I played with Adobe Flash. This assignment is assigned to the class by my Graphic Design teacher. The goal for this assignment is to create an animated figure to run across the forest from day to night. When I first started the project, I was very exciting because i'm very into animation. Even Though the project is based on the bone tool, but working with frames and timing caught on my attention. When I look back at this video, I notices that the character move faster at the second layer and even faster at the far back. It is caused by the length of the clip. All three walking clips are the same length, but the character is smaller and the scene is farer, which makes it looks like the character is speeding up. Next time dealing with timing, I will not make the same mistake again.
